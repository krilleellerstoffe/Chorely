### Run

The repository contains two separate projects: the client and the server. To run, open the server project in IntelliJ and launch the server by running the main method found in ServerController.java. You may have to change the project's JDK version to one that exists on your computer. Then launch the Android Studio project found in the client directory. 

At this stage of development, the only working functionality of the app is clicking on the "register new user" buttton, entering a username and password on the next screen, and then clicking on "register". A call is made to the server with the username and password, but no further processing is carried out.
